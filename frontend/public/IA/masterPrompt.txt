[CRITICAL TECHNICAL MANDATE: HARD MASK ENFORCEMENT] Analyze input 'lote1.png'. The area defined *exactly* by the solid hex color #ff0000 acts as an inviolable, HARD BINARY INPAINTING MASK. **ABSOLUTE CONSTRAINT RULES:** 1. **ZERO PIXEL MODIFICATION OUTSIDE MASK:** It is strictly forbidden to modify, alter, or regenerate ANY pixel outside the exact boundaries of the #ff0000 red strip. 2. **FROZEN CONTEXT:** The surrounding green land lots, the white dividing lines, the asphalt road at the bottom, and the entire forest area must remain mathematically identical to the original source image. 3. **BOUNDARY ADHERENCE:** The generated content must completely stop at the edge of the red area. No bleeding, spilling, or overlapping into the neighboring green zones is tolerated. [CONTENT GENERATION - CONFINED INSIDE MASK ONLY] Within the strict confines of the narrow red strip *only*, generate a drone view of a [[objetive]]. * **IMPORTANT:** The architecture and layout MUST be adapted to fit entirely inside this narrow, linear strip without crossing the edges. * [VISUAL INTEGRATION] Ensure the newly generated content inside the mask perfectly matches the lighting, sun direction, shadows, and isometric drone perspective of the frozen exterior areas. The blend at the very edge of the boundary line must be seamless. [SCALE REFERENCE - CRITICAL]: This single lot represents a massive 8-hectare (approx. 20 acres) area. The generated structures must appear small relative to the vast land. Include extensive internal roads with tiny visible cars (as micro-dots), multiple scattered buildings, and large landscaping areas to accurately reflect the huge scale. Photorealistic architectural master plan style, daylight.
